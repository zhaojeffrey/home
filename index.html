	        <p> The Rubik's cube was invented in 1974 by Ern≈ë Rubik. He was working as a professor in Budapest when he designed the cube to see if it was possible to turn something like it without the cube falling apart. It took him a month to solve it, and it was made of wood. He applied for a patent in 1975 and it was granted in 1977. It was originally called the Magic Cube, but Ideal Toy Company, which bought the rights to the cube in 1980, changed its name to the Rubik's Cube. The person who first thought of the sale, Tom Kremer, first saw it at the 1979 Nuremburg Toy Fair, where it was on display </p>
